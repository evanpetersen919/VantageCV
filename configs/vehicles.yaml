# Vehicle Configuration
# Auto-generated from UE5 level analysis
# rotation_offset: Yaw degrees to add so vehicle faces forward (+X direction)
#
# Usage: When spawning a vehicle, look up its mesh name here and apply the rotation_offset
# to ensure it faces the correct direction in parking slots

vehicles:
  # Vehicles with -90° offset (most common - face left, need to turn right)
  vehicle_type_1:
    rotation_offset: -90
    category: car
    length: 450
    width: 180
  
  # Vehicles with +90° offset (face right, need to turn left)
  vehicle_type_2:
    rotation_offset: 90
    category: car
    length: 450
    width: 180
  
  # Vehicles with 180° offset (face backward, need to flip)
  vehicle_type_3:
    rotation_offset: 180
    category: car
    length: 450
    width: 180

  # Default for unknown vehicles (face forward already)
  default:
    rotation_offset: 0
    category: car
    length: 450
    width: 180

# NOTE: You have 15 vehicles in your level with these offsets:
# -90°: 10 vehicles (StaticMeshActor 1,7,11,23,27,34,13,19,8)
# +90°: 3 vehicles (StaticMeshActor 5,9,26,2)
# 180°: 2 vehicles (StaticMeshActor 25, SkeletalMeshActor 5)
#
# To get actual mesh names, you'll need to check each actor in UE5 Content Browser
# For now, use default rotation_offset: 0 and manually adjust per vehicle type
